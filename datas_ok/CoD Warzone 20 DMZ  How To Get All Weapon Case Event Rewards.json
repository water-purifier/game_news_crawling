Just make sure you have a weapon with a decent fire rate, equip the stim shot tactical equipment, semtex or thermite as your lethal, and carry the munitions box field upgrade. These items will ensure you can get healed up quickly mid-fight and keep ammo and powerful lethals at your disposal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Check your map when spawning into a match to see if you have an armored vehicle close enough to your location.

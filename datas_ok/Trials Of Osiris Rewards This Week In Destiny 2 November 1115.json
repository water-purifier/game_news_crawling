If you're looking for some of the most high-level multiplayer action in the game, or you just want to have some fun in the 3v3 format mode, you can grab a Trials pass from Saint-14 in the Tower, get your best kit ready, and take a chance at winning a perfect run that will reward you with a coveted weapon when you're done.

Bungie has also adjusted Trials so that you earn rewards based on the number of <em>rounds</em>, rather than matches, you've won during your session, and added a reputation system that's similar to the Crucible and Gambit, making it easier to earn some of the Trials of Osiris's unique loot.</p><p>Finally, you'll earn Trials Engrams for participating in the mode, which you can cash in with Saint-14 during the weekend you receive them.

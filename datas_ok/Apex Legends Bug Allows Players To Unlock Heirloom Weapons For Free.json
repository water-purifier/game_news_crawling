Players who purchase all 24 cosmetic items included in the Collection Event (costing roughly $170 USD) will unlock that event's Heirloom Weapon.

Players are guaranteed to unlock at least one set of Heirloom Shards for every 500 Apex Packs they open, meaning they must have a great deal of patience--or spare cash--to get their hands on an Heirloom. Some players are lucky enough get their Heirloom Shards from the very first Apex Pack they open, while others must wait patiently for the RNG gods to bless them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Depending on how you go about unlocking it, a single Heirloom weapon will cost you anywhere from $170 to $500, so it's no surprise players are excited about the opportunity to \"test-drive\" Heirlooms they haven't unlocked yet.

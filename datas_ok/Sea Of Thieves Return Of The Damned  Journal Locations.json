This event is live in-game until November 17, and though it's perhaps the most straightforward of them all so far, knowing all journal locations still proves tricky, especially when you've got phantoms, skellies, and Ocean Crawlers breathing down your neck. Here's where to find all Return of the Damned journals.</p><h2>Sea of Thieves journals - Return of the Damned</h2><p>Characters in Sea of Thieves simply <em>love</em> writing in journals, about as much as folks in Rapture enjoy leaving audio logs. For this adventure, you'll need to find four journals in total, two from Belle and two from the Servant of the Flame. These journals never change spots, and two of them aren't far from where you'll greet these characters.</p><p>You can complete this Adventure in any order, playing it as the heroes (Belle) or villains (Servant) first. For this guide, we'll imagine you've sided with Belle first, but you can jump around as needed.</p><h3>Belle journal 1 - Shipwreck Bay</h3><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4061069-seaofthieves.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4061069\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4061069-seaofthieves.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4061069\"><img alt=\"Belle's first journal\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4061069-seaofthieves.png\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4061069-seaofthieves.png 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4061069-seaofthieves.png 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4061069-seaofthieves.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Belle's first journal</figcaption></figure><p>After you speak to Belle and before you leave Shipwreck Bay, head up to the Blackwytche wreck that sits beside Belle's camp.

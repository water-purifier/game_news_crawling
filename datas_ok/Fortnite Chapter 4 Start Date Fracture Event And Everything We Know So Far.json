We don't know a lot for sure about next season--the leaks have been few and far between so far. But there are plenty of rumors in the air, along with some datamined info that may or may not mean anything--and, so far, one official announcement. From battle pass rumors to start date inferrences, there's a lot to discuss. First, let's start off with what we know for sure about the next season of Fortnite.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Everything that's been officially announced about the next Fortnite season</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Epic hasn't made any reveals or anything about <em>next</em> season yet. But they have told us when this season, and chapter, are going to end: Saturday, December 3 at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. That's when the live Fracture event will take place that will wrap up Fortnite Chapter 3 and usher in Chapter 4.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4062913-fortnitechapter3fracturedevent.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4062913\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4062913-fortnitechapter3fracturedevent.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4062913\"><img alt=\"Epic announced the Fracture live event at this season's FNCS tournament.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4062913-fortnitechapter3fracturedevent.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4062913-fortnitechapter3fracturedevent.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4062913-fortnitechapter3fracturedevent.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4062913-fortnitechapter3fracturedevent.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Epic announced the Fracture live event at this season's FNCS tournament.</figcaption></figure><h2 dir=\"ltr\">When is Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1 going to actually begin?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">You should expect to be playing a new season of Fortnite on <strong>Sunday, December 4</strong>. The first time Fortnite transitioned to a new chapter at the end of Chapter 1, Epic took the game down for nearly two days, but after Chapter 2 it was down for just under a day. Anything from 12 to 48 hours is possible, but it's most likely that Fortnite will be back online at some point on December 4.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">A new Fortnite Chapter means a new map, right?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">While Chapter 3 is significantly shorter than past seasons were, you should expect a new map all the same. Just before the current season began, dataminers made note of a reference in files to <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/GMatrixGames/status/1570077831538810880\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a new \"launch option\" called Asteria</a>. Past \"launch options\" have included Athena, Apollo and Artemis--but you know those three better as each chapter's battle royale map. Athena was Chapter 1, Apollo was Chapter 2, and Artemis is the current island.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061618-fortnitechapter3season4map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4061618\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"1500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061618-fortnitechapter3season4map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4061618\"><img alt=\"Fortnite's Chapter 3 battle royale map, codenamed Artemis\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4061618-fortnitechapter3season4map.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061618-fortnitechapter3season4map.jpg 1500w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4061618-fortnitechapter3season4map.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4061618-fortnitechapter3season4map.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Chapter 3 battle royale map, codenamed Artemis</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">So it follows that Asteria, another ancient Greek deity whose name starts with A, is a new map to go with this new chapter. That said, Asteria may not be 100% new--we wouldn't be overly surprised if all these floating buildings survived into the new map.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Is Fortnite Creative 2.0 finally coming next season?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Creative 2.0, formally known as the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, has been rumored for December for a while now. This is going to be a huge deal for Epic--with a far more robust set of tools, creators may be able to build whole games inside Fortnite, a la Sony's Dreams. And that could, in the long term, shift Fortnite into being more of a platform than just a game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And it looked like Fortnite would be ushering in this new era alongside the introduction of Chapter 4. However, shortly after the announcement of the Fracture event, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted that the UEFN was being delayed. It's still scheduled for Chapter 4 Season 1, but not for launch.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1591978720889561088\" data-has-image=\"false\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 10px auto; display: flex; max-width: 550px;\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 0px; height: 0px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=GameSpot&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=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&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=true&amp;id=1591978720889561088&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffortnite-chapter-4-start-date-battle-pass-leaks%2F1100-6509089%2F&amp;sessionId=af90d7371c6801e9eb2976b8f0e2b3664d4ff0ff&amp;siteScreenName=GameSpot&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=a3525f077c700%3A1667415560940&amp;width=550px\" data-tweet-id=\"1591978720889561088\"></iframe></div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-mce-disable-toolbar=\"true\" data-twitter-extracted-i1669110591725204366=\"true\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Sorry folks, the team is working super hard, but the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) has been delayed to late January 2023.</p>  \u2014 Possibly Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1591978720889561088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote>              <script type=\"text/javascript\" class=\"optanon-category-C0004\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" data-service-name=\"twitter\" id=\"twitter-embed-1493135674\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What do we know about next season's gameplay changes?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">There have been several mechanics teased in the files for a long time now, like <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1534178428840206342?s=20&amp;t=G8wizOi61b72zuaysEqzLw\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">motorcycles</a> and <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1539299616016982018?s=20&amp;t=F5i3YXUy-LLLI7VeT4Zvvw\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">rideable skateboards</a>. Skateboarding, for one, may have been intended for Fortnite's big summer event--remember the skatepark they put up in the big bay on the eastern end of the island?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Likewise, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1571879590624202752?s=20&amp;t=NvaNF3i_P1UD8nUiY818hg\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">rideable flying animals</a> have been rumored for a minute as well. Not to mention <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1534187172126941184\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the first-person mode</a> that folks have been chattering about for a while now. We don't know if any of that stuff is for battle royale or just for the Creative 2.0 toolset (or both/neither).</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What will Fortnite's new season be about?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The current season has been surprisingly light on plot--this season hasn't had any new story quests since the ones we had on launch day. So that makes it difficult to guess what's in store for the last few weeks of this season, much less beyond that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But here's where we are right now: A creepy plant lady called The Herald is causing chrome to spread across the island. The Herald works for some kind of being or entity called The Nothing, whose voice we got to hear in the Bytes quests. Both The Herald and The Nothing have some kind of connection to The Last Reality, aka the place all the nefarious cubes came from in the previous chapters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As for the good guys: they seemingly all got chromed except for Brie Larson's new Paradigm, who went to some place called Reality-659 in the season trailer. And we haven't heard from her since then.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4061623\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4061623\"><img alt=\"Brie Larson's Paradigm has been out of the picture all season.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg 480w\" data-lazy-load=\"false\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brie Larson's Paradigm has been out of the picture all season.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1757/17577455/4061623-fortnitebrielarson.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brie Larson's Paradigm has been out of the picture all season.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Assuming this season does end with a live event, it'll likely involve The Herald's last push to fully chrome up the island, and presumably the Paradigm's attempt to resist with whatever she brings back from Reality-659. And if we <em>are</em> about to get a new Chapter with a new map, then maybe The Herald will succeed--with the new island being one scrambled by the chrome, like what happened with the black hole between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With so little info even about the immediate future, guessing what next season has in store for us is a fool's errand, especially with so many dangling plot threads out there--chief among them being the fate of big bads like the Cube Queen--not seen since the end of Chapter 2 Season 8--and Geno, the cosmic dude behind the IO, who we've heard nothing about since we took back the island from them in Chapter 3 Season 2.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And then we have the Zero War comic, which told the story of Chapter 3 Season 2 as if it were another Marvel season, complete with <a href=\"https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite_X_Marvel:_Zero_War_Issue_5\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a version of the Collision live event that was full of superheroes</a>--a version that we most definitely did not see in the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And while the climax of the event (The Foundation and Jonesey going after Geno) was presented as a cliffhanger at the time, in the comic they find Geno five seconds later. And then The Imagined grabs him and jumps into the Zero Point, disintegrating them both, but crucially <em>not </em>killing them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Are we going to catch up with Geno soon? Is the Cube Queen still around? Is The Nothing a separate faction or part of The Last Reality? Is there an in-universe explanation for why Zero War is completely incompatible with Fortnite's game story? Next season could deal with any of these topics.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What's coming with Fortnite's next battle pass?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">There have been no rumors or leaks thus far about next season's battle pass. Fans have identified a player skin from a past survey that pretty much everybody agrees is Geno based on his look in the Zero War comic, and if that is indeed the case then he'll probably be in a battle pass eventually. And that \"eventually\" could certainly be next season if he's a part of the story, too.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://twitter.com/FN_Assist/status/1563151362820489224\" data-has-image=\"true\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 10px auto; display: flex; max-width: 550px;\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 0px; height: 0px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=GameSpot&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-1&amp;features=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&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=true&amp;id=1563151362820489224&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffortnite-chapter-4-start-date-battle-pass-leaks%2F1100-6509089%2F&amp;sessionId=af90d7371c6801e9eb2976b8f0e2b3664d4ff0ff&amp;siteScreenName=GameSpot&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=a3525f077c700%3A1667415560940&amp;width=550px\" data-tweet-id=\"1563151362820489224\"></iframe></div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-mce-disable-toolbar=\"true\" data-twitter-extracted-i1669110591725204366=\"true\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Our confirmed look at GENO - Founder and Leader of The Imagined Order!<br>He will be officially revealed in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Fortnite</a> X Marvel: Zero War comics.

We don't know a lot for sure about next season--the leaks have been few and far between so far. But there are plenty of rumors in the air, along with some datamined info that may or may not mean anything--and, so far, one official announcement. From battle pass rumors to start date inferrences, there's a lot to discuss. First, let's start off with what we know for sure about the next season of Fortnite.\n\nEverything that's been officially announced about the next Fortnite season\n\nEpic hasn't made any reveals or anything about next season yet. But they have told us when this season, and chapter, are going to end: Saturday, December 3 at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. That's when the live Fracture event will take place that will wrap up Fortnite Chapter 3 and usher in Chapter 4.\n\nEpic announced the Fracture live event at this season's FNCS tournament.\nWhen is Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1 going to actually begin?\n\nYou should expect to be playing a new season of Fortnite on Sunday, December 4. The first time Fortnite transitioned to a new chapter at the end of Chapter 1, Epic took the game down for nearly two days, but after Chapter 2 it was down for just under a day. Anything from 12 to 48 hours is possible, but it's most likely that Fortnite will be back online at some point on December 4.\n\nA new Fortnite Chapter means a new map, right?\n\nWhile Chapter 3 is significantly shorter than past seasons were, you should expect a new map all the same. Just before the current season began, dataminers made note of a reference in files to a new \"launch option\" called Asteria. Past \"launch options\" have included Athena, Apollo and Artemis--but you know those three better as each chapter's battle royale map. Athena was Chapter 1, Apollo was Chapter 2, and Artemis is the current island.\n\nFortnite's Chapter 3 battle royale map, codenamed Artemis\n\nSo it follows that Asteria, another ancient Greek deity whose name starts with A, is a new map to go with this new chapter. That said, Asteria may not be 100% new--we wouldn't be overly surprised if all these floating buildings survived into the new map.\n\nIs Fortnite Creative 2.0 finally coming next season?\n\nCreative 2.0, formally known as the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, has been rumored for December for a while now. This is going to be a huge deal for Epic--with a far more robust set of tools, creators may be able to build whole games inside Fortnite, a la Sony's Dreams. And that could, in the long term, shift Fortnite into being more of a platform than just a game.\n\nAnd it looked like Fortnite would be ushering in this new era alongside the introduction of Chapter 4. However, shortly after the announcement of the Fracture event, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted that the UEFN was being delayed. It's still scheduled for Chapter 4 Season 1, but not for launch.\n\nSorry folks, the team is working super hard, but the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) has been delayed to late January 2023.\n\n\u2014 Possibly Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) November 14, 2022\nWhat do we know about next season's gameplay changes?\n\nThere have been several mechanics teased in the files for a long time now, like motorcycles and rideable skateboards. Skateboarding, for one, may have been intended for Fortnite's big summer event--remember the skatepark they put up in the big bay on the eastern end of the island?\n\nLikewise, rideable flying animals have been rumored for a minute as well. Not to mention the first-person mode that folks have been chattering about for a while now. We don't know if any of that stuff is for battle royale or just for the Creative 2.0 toolset (or both/neither).\n\nWhat will Fortnite's new season be about?\n\nThe current season has been surprisingly light on plot--this season hasn't had any new story quests since the ones we had on launch day. So that makes it difficult to guess what's in store for the last few weeks of this season, much less beyond that.\n\nBut here's where we are right now: A creepy plant lady called The Herald is causing chrome to spread across the island. The Herald works for some kind of being or entity called The Nothing, whose voice we got to hear in the Bytes quests. Both The Herald and The Nothing have some kind of connection to The Last Reality, aka the place all the nefarious cubes came from in the previous chapters.\n\nAs for the good guys: they seemingly all got chromed except for Brie Larson's new Paradigm, who went to some place called Reality-659 in the season trailer. And we haven't heard from her since then.\n\nBrie Larson's Paradigm has been out of the picture all season.\n\nAssuming this season does end with a live event, it'll likely involve The Herald's last push to fully chrome up the island, and presumably the Paradigm's attempt to resist with whatever she brings back from Reality-659. And if we are about to get a new Chapter with a new map, then maybe The Herald will succeed--with the new island being one scrambled by the chrome, like what happened with the black hole between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.\n\nWith so little info even about the immediate future, guessing what next season has in store for us is a fool's errand, especially with so many dangling plot threads out there--chief among them being the fate of big bads like the Cube Queen--not seen since the end of Chapter 2 Season 8--and Geno, the cosmic dude behind the IO, who we've heard nothing about since we took back the island from them in Chapter 3 Season 2.\n\nAnd then we have the Zero War comic, which told the story of Chapter 3 Season 2 as if it were another Marvel season, complete with a version of the Collision live event that was full of superheroes--a version that we most definitely did not see in the game.\n\nAnd while the climax of the event (The Foundation and Jonesey going after Geno) was presented as a cliffhanger at the time, in the comic they find Geno five seconds later. And then The Imagined grabs him and jumps into the Zero Point, disintegrating them both, but crucially not killing them.\n\nAre we going to catch up with Geno soon? Is the Cube Queen still around? Is The Nothing a separate faction or part of The Last Reality? Is there an in-universe explanation for why Zero War is completely incompatible with Fortnite's game story? Next season could deal with any of these topics.\n\nWhat's coming with Fortnite's next battle pass?\n\nThere have been no rumors or leaks thus far about next season's battle pass. Fans have identified a player skin from a past survey that pretty much everybody agrees is Geno based on his look in the Zero War comic, and if that is indeed the case then he'll probably be in a battle pass eventually. And that \"eventually\" could certainly be next season if he's a part of the story, too.\n\nOur confirmed look at GENO - Founder and Leader of The Imagined Order!\nHe will be officially revealed in #Fortnite X Marvel: Zero War comics. He also matches the new skin seen in yesterday's survey as well as the photograph with Slone from a while back!\n(Img: @HYPEX) pic.twitter.com/a8p7fsKKJ0\n\n\u2014 FNAssist  (@FN_Assist) August 26, 2022\n\nOther than that, we have no leads about next season's battle pass.

In brief, this is a nerf that makes it harder to recover and aim after being shot. There have also been changes to specific models of linear fusion rifles. The aim assist cones on the Arbalest and Lorentz Driver were reduced by 35%. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-adjusting-a-destiny-2-weapon-type-sooner-than-expected/1100-6508957/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6508957\">These balance adjustments were originally meant to launch with Season 19,</a> but Bungie fast tracked them to this hotfix.</p><p>In other smaller changes, the patch fixes an issue where some shaders applied textures incorrectly to Festival of the Lost-themed armor ornaments.

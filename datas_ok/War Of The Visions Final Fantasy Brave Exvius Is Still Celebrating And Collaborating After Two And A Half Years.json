FFBE was created as an evolution of the pixel art Final Fantasy titles, from FFI to FFVI. When considering the next project, we decided to develop a game based on the tactical RPG aspect of Final Fantasy Tactics, which was very popular within the Final Fantasy series, and at the time, an evolved version of the game had not yet been released.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>As it celebrates its 2.5-year anniversary, how has War of the Visions\u2019 goals changed through the years? Has the game changed dramatically in that time?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">First of all, thank you for continuing to play War Of The Visions Final Fantasy Brave Exvius. Because of everyone\u2019s support, we were able to ring in our 2.5-year anniversary. When we first released the game, our goal was to have as many players as possible play WOTVFFBE. That in itself remains unchanged today, but we are now also focused on making sure the current players are enjoying the game. To this end, we\u2019ve added new elements such as Raid Boss Battles, EX Jobs, and Truststones, as well as improving the UI to make the game easier to play and making updates in order to have everyone enjoy it over a long period of time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why celebrate 2.5 years? It's not a typical anniversary milestone.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We thought we should have as many fun things as possible and decided to celebrate the half anniversary as well. I feel that the advantage of turning this into an anniversary is being able to host events that can be enjoyed by the players, such as special collaborations and log-in bonuses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Is the game welcoming to newcomers? What incentives are available for new players to start now, 2.5 years after release?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those who just started the game will receive a beginner\u2019s log-in bonus, which includes 10,000 Visiore, the \u201cIfrit\u201d Vision Card, and a Level 99 UR unit summon ticket. On top of that, we are running a new-registration campaign, in which players may obtain the \u201cRamuh\u201d and \u201cChocobo\u201d Vision Cards. By using these to build your party, I believe you\u2019ll comfortably progress through the game, at least for a while. As you play, I would recommend raising more units to build an even stronger party.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the process of arranging collaborations with other Square Enix properties like internally or otherwise?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">When considering a collaboration, we consult the IP holder with whom we will collaborate. What is important when pursuing a collaboration is whether or not there is a mutual benefit. We discuss what we can do in order to not only produce benefits on our side, but for the partner\u2019s IP as well, and proceed upon reaching a mutual agreement.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you decide what collaborations to pursue?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We ask which IPs people like during livestreams and fan events, keep our ears open to community feedback, and sometimes conduct market research to ponder about what titles players would especially enjoy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What has been the most successful collaboration?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">For us, we believe success depends on how much we can satisfy the players who have been eagerly awaiting the collaboration. We\u2019ve received many differing comments, but we believe players have been able to enjoy every collaboration.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you offer a summary of the current story of War of the Visions and what is happening right now?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Part two, the War of the Gale Highlands, is now in its final stages, and we are finally facing the final battle with Sadali. Players will have to see for themselves how this battle will end. For those who have just begun playing the game, please enjoy the story from Part One. We hope you will enjoy this ensemble drama of love, friendship, betrayal, and hatred among the various characters.</p><div data-embed-type=\"imageGallery\" data-ref-id=\"4038\"><div class=\"image-gallery__header\">Best Final Fantasy Games, Ranked</div><div class=\"image-gallery__main\"><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1701/17013431/3968303-gs9ff7.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1701/17013431/3968305-gs1ff2.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1701/17013431/3968306-gs2ff15.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1701/17013431/3968307-gs3ff13.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_petite/1701/17013431/3968308-gs4ff3.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_petite/1701/17013431/3968309-gs5ff1.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item\"><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_petite/1701/17013431/3968310-gs6ff9.jpg\"></div><div class=\"image-gallery__item image-gallery__item--show-more\"><a class=\"js-click-tag\" data-click-tag=\"image gallery|see more\" href=\"/gallery/best-final-fantasy-games-ranked/2900-4038/\">See More</a></div></div></div>\n  \n                        \n    \n        <div class=\"js-mapped-ad mapped-ad mapped-mpu_middle mapped-mpu_middle-dart js-seamless-middle-mpu float-right no-inner-space\" data-ad-type=\"mpu_middle\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-mpu_middle\"></div></div>\n        <div class=\"js-mapped-ad mapped-ad mapped-mpu_bottom mapped-mpu_bottom-dart js-seamless-bottom-mpu float-right no-inner-space\" data-ad-type=\"mpu_bottom\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-mpu_bottom\"></div></div>\n  \n                        <div class=\"js-inline-widget\" id=\"inline-bottom\"></div>          ", "page_text_en": "Two-and-a-half years ago, War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius came to mobile devices, bringing with it tactical RPG gameplay not seen in the Final Fantasy franchise since Final Fantasy Tactics.

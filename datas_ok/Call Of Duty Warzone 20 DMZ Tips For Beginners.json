This is more of an objective-based sandbox game that plays very different to battle royale. With many ways to tackle a round, including a variety of objectives all set in a PvPvE environment, it can be a lot to take in. Here we'll list some tips and general information to help you get started and make the most of your time in DMZ mode.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Quick DMZ overview</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">DMZ is a trios mode in a PvPvE environment, where you can have the option to choose how you want to play, which includes looting for high-value items and weapons and completing faction objectives. You keep everything you loot with a successful exfil, but you risk losing almost everything if you die and fail to extract from the match.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">General DMZ tips for beginners</h2><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Weapons work differently than battle royale</h3><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4065589-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_20221117165816%283%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4065589\" data-ratio=\"0.59868708971554\" data-width=\"2285\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2285px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.9%\" href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4065589-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_20221117165816%283%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4065589\"><img alt=\"DMZ's insured weapon blueprints and Contraband weapon types\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394540/4065589-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_20221117165816%283%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4065589-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_20221117165816%283%29.jpg 2285w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394540/4065589-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_20221117165816%283%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394540/4065589-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_20221117165816%283%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>DMZ's insured weapon blueprints and Contraband weapon types</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before loading into a match of DMZ, it's important to understand how weapon loadouts work. Here's a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-dmz-mode-how-weapon-loadouts-work/1100-6509174/de:%20Contraband%20and%20Blueprints./\">full guide to DMZ weapon types</a>, but basically, there are weapons you extract from the mode called Contraband, and there are the weapons you customize with the Gunsmith to take into DMZ, and those are called weapon blueprints.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your custom blueprints are the only items that you won't permanently lose from a failed DMZ mission, but you do get penalized for not successfully extracting from the match. This penalty is a two-hour cooldown timer. Here we offer a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-dmz-how-to-unlock-more-insured-weapon-slots-and-reduce-cooldown-penalties/1100-6509298/\">DMZ guide for how to unlock more insured weapon slots and reduce the cooldown penalty faster</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you choose to go into a mission with your custom weapon blueprint, a Contraband weapon, or nothing at all will depend on what your goal is for the match. If your objective is just to go in and scavenge loot and money to extract with, it's not worth risking your best guns. You can easily load into a match with just your fists, melee the first AI you see, and take their weapon. Or you can scavenge a building and likely find something to use.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Save the better guns for when you're loading in for something specific that requires more firepower, such as clearing out Strongholds or a series of difficult faction missions.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Freebies and early essentials</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure to always load into a match with your lethal, tactical and field upgrade equipment. You always get to pick these items at the start of a match, and you never lose access to them. I recommend the munitions box for the best field upgrade, so you always have ammo at your disposal. You can always scavenge more or different lethals and tactical equipment, but always take those freebies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once in the match, look for the vests that let you equip more armor. You can buy these from Buy Stations, but there's a good chance you'll loot one if you search nearby buildings.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Easy weapon unlocks</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">One really important thing to note is that if you're new or only have Warzone 2.0, <strong>you can unlock weapons much faster in DMZ</strong>. Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.0 have a complex weapon progression system that requires you to use certain weapons to unlock others, but you can bypass this hassle by simply extracting with guns in DMZ. Everytime you exfil with a weapon you don't already have unlocked, it will unlock it for use across all modes. So, if you find a new gun you like, make sure you exfil with it.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Start faction missions early</h3><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4065588-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_202211171659182.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4065588\" data-ratio=\"0.56269430051813\" data-width=\"1930\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1930px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4065588-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_202211171659182.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4065588\"><img alt=\"DMZ faction missions\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394540/4065588-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_202211171659182.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4065588-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_202211171659182.jpeg 1930w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394540/4065588-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_202211171659182.jpeg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394540/4065588-callofduty%C2%AE_modernwarfareii_202211171659182.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a><figcaption>DMZ faction missions</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Before loading into a match, you'll have the option to choose three faction missions to complete in-game.

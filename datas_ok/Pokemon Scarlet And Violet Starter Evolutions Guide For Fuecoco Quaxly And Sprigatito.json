Pokemon Scarlet and Violet don't break from tradition too much, once again presenting you with three adorable creatures representing the three most fundamental types in the series: fire (Fuecoco), water (Quaxly), and grass (Sprigatito). Before you make your selection, though, you might want to know more about what they ultimately become through their evolutions, and that's where we can help.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, the final evolutions of all three Pokemon revolve around different types of stage performers. As a result, each of them look bipedal to some extent. Adorable little Fuecoco, for example, becomes Skeledirge, the \"Singer Pokemon,\" and its entry in the Pokedex reflects the posing of an opera singer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The three also get some unusual subtypes this time around. Typically Fire has been matched with Fighting, to the point that Pokemon fans crack jokes at the repetition, but this time it's Quaxly's water evolution that gets a Fighting subtype. Fuecoco evolves into a Fire and Ghost type, while Sprigatito gets Grass and Dark combo. They each learn a handful of other move types as well--for example, Sprigatito eventually learns the Fairy-type move Play Rough.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whichever you choose, your rival Nemona will choose the one weak to it. So if you choose Sprigatito, for example, you'll regularly battle against Nemona and her Quaxly, because water is weak to grass. Ultimately which one you choose will depend on personal preference, and as always there will be plenty of fire, water, and grass Pokemon roaming the wild to fill any gaps in your roster.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sprigatito -
